Nothing is uploaded anywhere. If you do create an account, we additionally sync your watch progress and recent generation history so it follows you across devices.",

This data never leaves your device, and clearing your browser data erases it completely. We use Microsoft Clarity for anonymous, cookieless usage analytics (heatmaps and session recordings) to understand how the site is used. Clarity masks all input content by default.",

That's the entire list. We do not ask for or store your real name, payment details, or any third-party service credentials.",
